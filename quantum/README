THIS IS THE ASSIGNMENT INVOLVING EVOLUTION OF A QUANTUM MECHANICAL SYSTEM USING THE TIME DEPENDENT SCHRODINGER EQUATION
VIA NUMERICAL SIMULATIONS.

quantum.cpp IS A C++ PROGRAM WHICH IS USED TO GENERATE THE DATA FILES STARTING FROM A GIVEN GAUSSIAN WAVEPACKET AND IT PRODUCES 
THE EVOLVED STATE OF THE INITIAL WAVEPACKET UNDER TIME EVOLUTION AND SAVES IT TO A FILE. 

make_movie.py IS A PYTHON PROGRAM WHICH IS USED TO PLOT THE DATA FILES GENERATED FROM THE PREVIOUS PROGRAM TO MAKE THE FRAMES 
OF THE QUANTUM SIMULATION ANIMATION.
